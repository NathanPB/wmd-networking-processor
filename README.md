# WheresMyDuo Networking Processor Specification v1.0.0

## Target
The target of the Networking Processor Module is to process thousands of different WheresMyDuo Gaming Profiles per second and find the ones who are promising about social interaction based in pre-defined conditions.

## How
Since performance **is** a problem in this context, I analyzed benchmarks and paradigms and found the best way of dealing with this problem for now: Functional Programming.
